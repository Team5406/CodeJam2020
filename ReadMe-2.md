## About The Project
The game's story takes place on the planet Mars. The player will be tasked in a Rocket Building competition to build a rocket to fly to the Mars Space Station. Whoever has the better rocket at the end of the 20 adventures, wins the game, and their rocket will be used! The user will be interacting with items scattered around the surface of Mars, they will also be trading with their opponent, to help receive better parts.
**Helping**: The player can call the opponent, and start a trade. The opponent will ask for one of the items you have at random. You can choose to keep your item or trade it for their item. If you accept enough trades, you will be offered parts that can not be found elsewhere. You get a limited number of trades (including declined trades), forcing you to sometimes give away items you want, to eventually get better items. The fewer trades you do, the better items your opponent uses on their rocket.
