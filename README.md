## About The Project
The game's story takes place on the planet Mars. The player will be tasked with building a rocket in a Rocket Building competition to fly to the Mars Space Station. Whoever has the better rocket at the end wins the game, and their rocket will be used! The user will be interacting with items scattered across the surface of Mars and will also be trading with their opponent to receive better rocket parts.

**Helping**: The player can call their opponent and start a trade. The opponent will ask for one of the items you have at random. You can choose to keep your item or trade it for their item. If you accept enough trades, you will be offered parts that can not be found elsewhere. You get a limited number of trades (including declined trades), forcing you to sometimes give away items you want, to eventually get better items. The fewer trades you do, the better items your opponent uses on their rocket.

Download the public release on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Team5406/CodeJam2020). There is a download for MacOS, Windows 10, and Linux. Once downloaded, extract the contents of the file into a folder of your choosing. **THE APPLICATION WILL NOT RUN IF THE PROJECT FILES ARE NOT IN THE SAME FOLDER OF THE APPLICATION**. Open the folder where you saved the files from the .ZIP file, and open either the .app file (On MacOS), or the .exe file (On Windows). You can now start to play our game!

## Usage

## Item Descriptions
 - **Capsule**: Control centre of the rocketâ€” this is where astronauts stay during flight.
 -  **Fuel Tank**: Stores all the fuel needed to fly the rocket.
 -  **Engine**: This is where the fuel combusts releasing enough thrust to push the rocket into space.
 -  **Battery**:Stores power needed to run tech devices in the capsule during flight.
 -  **Fuel**: Combustible fluid that is used to create thrust to fly the rocket.
 
 ## Known Issues
 - **Trading**: Unable to actually trade at the moment.
 -  **Scoring**: Very simplified scoring.
 -  **Blackout**: Buggy at best
